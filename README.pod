=head1 rgit - remote git script

Run simple git operations (diff/log/add/commit/...) from outside the working directory.

=head2 SYNOPSIS

Run git commands as if you were inside the working directory. This is useful
when you want to avoid changing directory all the time when working with
multiple repositories.

    cd /tmp    
    rgit diff /home/d5ve/checkout1
    rgit add /home/d5ve/checkout1/*.pl
    rgit commit /home/d5ve/checkout1/

B<rgit> examines the commandline arguments, and tries to work out the
I<GIT_WORK_TREE> and I<GIT_DIR> environmental variables from any file paths.
